# RFD Index System with Google Docs Integration

## Overview
Build a centralized index system for Request for Discussion (RFD) documents stored in Google Docs, allowing teams to discover, track, and manage RFDs efficiently.

## Core Features

### 1. RFD Discovery & Indexing
- [ ] Connect to Google Drive API to scan for RFD documents
- [ ] Auto-detect RFD documents by naming convention or folder structure
- [ ] Extract metadata from Google Docs (title, author, creation date, last modified)
- [ ] Parse RFD status from document content (Draft, Review, Approved, Rejected, etc.)

### 2. RFD Database Schema
- [x] Design database schema for RFD metadata
- [x] Store: ID, title, author, status, Google Doc URL, tags, summary
- [x] Track revision history and status changes
- [ ] Index for fast searching

### 3. Web Interface
- [ ] RFD listing page with search and filters
- [ ] Individual RFD detail pages
- [ ] Status-based views (active, approved, archived)
- [ ] Author and tag-based filtering

### 4. Google Docs Integration
- [ ] OAuth integration for Google Drive access
- [ ] Sync RFD content and metadata from Google Docs
- [ ] Handle document permissions and access control
- [ ] Real-time updates when documents change (webhooks/polling)

### 5. RFD Workflow Management
- [ ] Status tracking (Draft → Review → Decision → Archived)
- [ ] Comment and discussion threads
- [ ] Approval workflow integration
- [ ] Email notifications for status changes

### 6. Search & Navigation
- [ ] Full-text search across RFD titles and summaries
- [ ] Tag-based categorization
- [ ] Recently updated RFDs
- [ ] Popular/frequently accessed RFDs

## Technical Implementation

### Backend
- [ ] Google Drive API integration
- [ ] Database design and migrations
- [ ] API endpoints for RFD CRUD operations
- [ ] Background jobs for syncing with Google Docs

### Frontend
- [ ] RFD index page with sorting/filtering
- [ ] Search interface
- [ ] RFD detail pages with Google Docs embed
- [ ] Admin interface for managing RFDs

### Authentication
- [ ] Extend existing Google Auth to include Drive permissions
- [ ] Role-based access control
- [ ] Integration with Google Docs sharing permissions

## Next Steps
1. Set up Google Drive API credentials
2. Design database schema for RFDs
3. Implement basic Google Docs synchronization
4. Build RFD listing interface
5. Add search and filtering capabilities
